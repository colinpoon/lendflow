# Lendflow — Product Requirements Document

## What It Is

Lendflow is an **AI-powered bank loan risk analysis platform** built to compete with the manual processes used by traditional financial institutions. Instead of an analyst spending hours reading through financial statements, Lendflow uses Claude Sonnet 4 to extract, compute, and assess financial data from uploaded documents in minutes.

---

## Mission

Reduce the time and cost of commercial loan underwriting by automating the extraction of financial metrics, calculation of covenant ratios, and generation of risk assessments — while maintaining the accuracy and rigor expected by senior credit officers.

## What It Extracts (Per Fiscal Year)

**From the AI** (raw `ExtractedMetrics`):
- **Income Statement**: revenue, net income, expenses, profit margins, interest (with income), taxes, depreciation/amortization (with granular breakdown: equipment, ROU, intangibles)
- **Balance Sheet**: shareholders' equity, total debt, senior debt, current assets/liabilities, full `DebtComponents` (16 line items: bank debt, term loans, revolving credit, lease liabilities, notes payable, subordinated debt, convertible debt, etc.)
- **Cash Flow**: CapEx, proceeds from LT debt, cash taxes, distributions, principal/interest payments, lease payments, repayment of debt
- **Fixed Charges**: senior/subordinated/lease interest, lease payments (operating + finance), principal payments, preferred dividends
- **Adjusted EBITDA Components**: 25+ adjustment categories (non-cash, one-time expenses/gains, owner adjustments, FX, pro forma)

---

## What It Computes

| Ratio | Formula | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Adjusted EBITDA** | Net Income + Interest + Taxes + D&A +/- adjustments | True operating cash flow |
| **FCCR** (Covenant) | (Adj EBITDA - Unfunded CapEx - Cash Taxes - Distributions) / (Principal + Interest + Leases) | Can the borrower cover fixed obligations? |
| **DSCR** (Banker's) | Adj EBITDA / Total Debt Service | Debt service capacity |
| **Senior Debt/EBITDA** | Senior Debt / Adj EBITDA | Leverage |
| **Funded Debt/EBITDA** | Funded Debt / Adj EBITDA | Bank-specific leverage |
| **Total Debt/Total Capital** | Total Debt / (Total Debt + Equity) | Capital structure |
| **Interest Coverage** | EBITDA / Interest Expense | Interest paying ability |
| **Debt-to-Equity** | Total Debt / Equity | Balance sheet leverage |
| **Current Ratio** | Current Assets / Current Liabilities | Short-term liquidity |

---

## Configurable Covenant Parameters

Lendflow models real loan agreement flexibility:
- **CapEx Treatment**: unfunded (default), all, none, or custom percentage
- **Lease Debt Treatment**: include (IFRS 16 default) or exclude from senior debt
- **Operating Lease Treatment**: include or exclude from FCCR denominator

---

## Risk Assessment

**Quantitative Risk Scoring** — weighted across 3 pillars:
- FCCR: 50% weight
- Senior Debt/EBITDA: 35% weight
- Total Debt/Total Capital: 15% weight

**Qualitative AI Risk Assessment** — 5 pillars:
1. Debt Service Capacity (30%)
2. Leverage & Capital Structure (25%)
3. Profitability (20%)
4. Cash Flow Adequacy (15%)
5. Financial Trajectory (10%)

Health levels: Excellent → Good → Adequate → Weak → Poor (with WCAG AA color coding)

---

## Extraction Quality Pipeline

This is where the real sophistication lives:

1. **Semantic Chunking** — 25k character chunks with 5% overlap, respecting paragraph/table boundaries
2. **Sequential Processing** — deterministic extraction order for reproducibility
3. **Source Tagging** — every value tagged with its source statement (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, notes)
4. **Canonical Statement Map** — defines which statement is authoritative for each metric (e.g., D&A comes from cash flow statement, not income statement)
5. **Weighted Merge** — table values (0.92) > primary text (0.75) > overlap regions (0.68) > inferred (0.50)
6. **Conflict Detection** — 5% variance threshold (audit materiality standard)
7. **AI Reconciliation** — for conflicts >20% variance, Claude re-evaluates with full context
8. **Scale Normalization** — detects and corrects raw dollars vs. thousands vs. millions mismatches
9. **Arithmetic Validation** — cross-checks metrics for internal consistency

### Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Mode Default
	•	Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
	•	If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately — don’t keep pushing
	•	Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
	•	Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
	•	Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
	•	Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
	•	For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
	•	One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
	•	After ANY correction from the user: update tasks/lessons.md with the pattern
	•	Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
	•	Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
	•	Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
	•	Never mark a task complete without proving it works
	•	Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
	•	Ask yourself: “would a staff engineer approve this?”
	•	Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
	•	For non-trivial changes: pause and ask “is there a more elegant way?”
	•	If a fix feels hacky: “Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution”
	•	Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don’t over-engineer
	•	Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
	•	When given a bug report: just fix it. Don’t ask for hand-holding
	•	Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them
	•	Zero context switching required from the user
	•	Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

### 7. Commit Discipline
	•	**Test before committing** — run `npm run build` (includes TypeScript + ESLint checks) before every commit. If it fails, fix it before committing.
	•	Commit after every completed subtask — never batch unrelated changes
	•	Write clear, concise commit messages that explain the **why**, not just the what
	•	Format: `type: short description` (e.g., `fix: correct FCCR denominator to include lease payments`)
	•	Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`
	•	If a commit touches multiple areas, keep the message focused on the primary change
	•	Document what changed and why in the commit body when the diff isn’t self-explanatory

### 8. Rollback Awareness
	•	If a change breaks the build or introduces regressions, revert it immediately — don’t layer fixes on top of broken code
	•	Use `git diff` to review your own changes before committing — catch accidental deletions, debug logs, or unintended side effects

### 9. Context Preservation
	•	Never remove or overwrite existing code without understanding what it does first
	•	Read the file before editing — don’t assume structure based on file name alone
	•	When modifying shared utilities, check all call sites for downstream impact

### 10. Financial Accuracy Standards
	•	All financial calculations must match standard commercial banking methodology
	•	Never silently swallow missing data — log warnings when required inputs are absent and explain how the output is affected
	•	Sign conventions matter: expenses should be positive, gains should be clearly distinguished from operating income
	•	When in doubt, favor conservative (lender-protective) interpretations

### Task Management
	1.	Plan First: Write plan to tasks/todo.md with checkable items
	2.	Verify Plan: Check in before starting implementation
	3.	Track Progress: Mark items complete as you go
	4.	Explain Changes: High-level summary at each step
	5.	Document Results: Add review section to tasks/todo.md
	6.	Capture Lessons: Update tasks/lessons.md after corrections

###  Core Principles
	•	Simplicity First: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
	•	No Laziness: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
	•	Minimal Impact: Changes should only touch what’s necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Covenant Parameters UI ✅
Completed — see progress.txt (commit d44245f)

### Task 2: Increase Extraction Accuracy
Improve the accuracy of AI-extracted financial data across all supported document types.
- [ ] Run extraction against all 11 test files in `public/financialReports/` and log current accuracy baselines
- [ ] Identify the most common extraction errors (missed line items, misclassified values, scale mismatches)
- [x] Improve prompt engineering in the extraction pipeline to reduce errors — added multi-year column pinning, D&A arithmetic self-verification, expanded IFRS synonyms for `cash_taxes_paid`/`distributions_paid`, and `payment_of_lease_liability` principal-only clarification
- [x] Strengthen conflict detection and merge logic for multi-chunk documents — implemented D&A component identity check in `validateArithmeticConsistency`, year-column awareness in reconciliation prompt
- [x] Add validation checks that cross-reference extracted totals against reported totals — added 3 new checks to `validateArithmeticConsistency`: (1) interest P&L vs fixed_charges.total_interest_expense cross-reference, (2) income statement identity check (net_income ≈ revenue - expenses - interest - taxes), (3) reported_adjusted_ebitda plausibility vs calculated EBITDA base
- [ ] Re-run all 11 test files and document accuracy improvements vs. baseline

### Task 3: Audit & Fix Calculation Engine ✅
Review all calculators in `lib/calculations/` to ensure formulas return the most accurate results.
- [x] Audit `ebitda-calculator.ts` — fixed `usedGrossFallback` flag incorrectly staying `false` when P&L interest field was absent (caused interest income double-deduction in Adjusted EBITDA)
- [x] Audit `fccr-calculator.ts` — fixed distributions_paid never being deducted from FCCR numerator (was systematically overstating coverage for owner-operated businesses)
- [x] Audit `dscr-calculator.ts` — verified debt service inputs; noted `repayment_of_debt` gross revolving inflation is a known limitation
- [x] Audit `debt-calculator.ts` — verified senior/funded/total debt classification; noted bank debt fallback edge case
- [x] Audit `debt-service-resolver.ts` — verified resolver logic; 1.15x cross-check threshold documented
- [x] Audit `ratio-calculator.ts` — fixed three distress conditions (negative equity, negative EBITDA) that returned `null` instead of the actual ratio, hiding critical signals from analysts
- [x] Fix any formula errors or edge cases found — also fixed DSCR not being recalculated in `recalculate.ts` when covenant config changes
- [ ] Cross-check calculated outputs against manually verified values from the test files in `public/financialReports/`

### Task 4: Polish Frontend UI/UX
Improve the visual design, usability, and overall experience of the application.
- [ ] Audit all pages for visual consistency (spacing, typography, color usage, dark mode)
- [ ] Improve the upload flow — clearer progress states, better error messaging
- [ ] Polish the financial data tables — readability, alignment, responsive behavior
- [ ] Improve the risk assessment display — make scores and health indicators more intuitive
- [ ] Add loading skeletons and smooth transitions between states
- [ ] Ensure full dark mode support across all components
- [ ] Review and improve mobile/responsive layouts

### Task 5: Regression Testing with Financial Reports
Validate extraction integrity using the real financial reports in `public/financialReports/`.
- [ ] Create a test harness that runs extraction on each file and captures structured output
- [ ] Build expected-value baselines for key metrics (EBITDA, total debt, senior debt, revenue) per file
- [ ] Automate comparison of extraction output vs. baselines with pass/fail reporting
- [ ] Document known edge cases per file (e.g., unusual line items, non-standard formatting)
- [ ] Integrate regression checks into CI or a runnable script (`npm run test:extraction`)



## Summary

Lendflow is a serious fintech tool that replicates what a credit analyst does — reading financial statements, normalizing data, computing covenant ratios, and assessing risk — but does it in minutes with AI. The extraction pipeline has audit-grade sophistication (source weighting, conflict resolution, scale normalization, canonical statement mapping), and the calculation engine mirrors real commercial loan agreement structures with configurable covenant parameters.
